# MuPDF Android Viewer with some tweaks

This project is a simplified variant of the full MuPDF Android app that only
supports viewing documents. The annotation editing and form filling features
are not present here.

This project builds both a viewer library and a viewer application.
The viewer library can be used to view PDF and other documents.

The application is a simple file chooser that shows a list of documents on the
external storage on your device, and hands off the selected file to the viewer
library.

# Tweaks

- DoubleTap to zoom.
- Removed annoying 'tap margin to change page' feature.
